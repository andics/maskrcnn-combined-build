Currently the image-inference script is made to generate visualizations without neuronal activations
TODO:
 - Move the default parameters from the Model_single class to a config file
 - Understand what those parameters do (eg confidence_threshold)
 - Add a logging mechanism throughout the entire experiment. Allows for easier debugging later on
 - Make GT to be displayed on the same image as prediction
FINALLY:
 - Make hooks for recording neuron values
