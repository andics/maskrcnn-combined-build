This script performs evaluation on bins (containing a particular range of
area in high-res/total area) for their annotation objects

For each bin annotation, it selects a subset of objects which are dependant on the SMALLEST number of
annotations FOR SOME OBJECT TYPE in the smallest bin.

Note: this version DOES equalize the number of annotations of each type (small, med, large)
