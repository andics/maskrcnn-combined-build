The folder contains a script for shifting a dataset in either corner of an image as
measured by percentage. E.g. 50/50 would shift the image to the lower right corer,
splitting it exactly into 4 pieces

The percentages are measured starting from the top left corner.

No fragments essentially means that the white spots around the edges of the shifted dataset
have been removed
This script does exactly that: removes the white spots
