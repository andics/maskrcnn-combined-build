The following folder contains the original validation file for COCO
filtered based on the area of its annotations contained in the high-resolution middle
area of the image (100x100)
Note that this file is in leu of the annotation file in the coco_2017_variable_val dataset
and the coco_2017_constant_val

Both of those datasets use the original annotation file for COCO, so our modified version
of the original is a valid substitute, which is important to keep in mind
